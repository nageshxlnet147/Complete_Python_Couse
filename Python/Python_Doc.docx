Intro to Programming with Python:

Software
Software is a set of instructions to the hardware.
Programming
Programming means writing the instructions to create a software.
Code
The instructions that we write to create software is called Code.
Syntax
Similar to Grammar rules in English, Hindi, each programming language has a unique set of rules. These rules are called the Syntax of a Programming Language.
Why Python
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. With Python, it is possible to create programs with minimal amount of code. Look at the code in Java and Python used for printing the message "Hello World"
print("Hello World")

Applications of Python
Python is a versatile language which has applications in almost every field
	• Artificial intelligence (AI)
	• Machine Learning (ML)
	• Big Data
	• Smart Devices/Internet of Things (IoT)
	• Cyber Security
	• Game Development
	• Backend Development, etc.
Career Opportunities
Python developers have plenty of opportunities across the world
	• DevOps Engineer
	• Software Developer
	• Data Analyst
	• Data Scientist
	• Machine Learning (ML) Engineer
	• AI Scientist, etc.
Hello World Program in Python
Here is a simple Python code that you can use to display the message "Hello World"
Code 

print("Hello World!")

Possible Mistakes
Possible mistakes you may make while writing Python code to display the message "Hello World"
	• Spelling Mistake in print

prnt("Hello World!")

• Uppercase ‘P’ in Print
• Print("Hello World!")
• Missing quotes
• print(Hello World!)
• Missing parentheses
• print("Hello World!"
Printing Without Quotes
If we want to print the numerical result of 2 + 5, we do not add quotes.
Code
print(2 + 5)

If we want to print the exact message "2 + 5", then we add the quotes.

print("2 + 5")
